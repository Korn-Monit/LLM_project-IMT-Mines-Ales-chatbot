File Description:
### ChatBot_Colab is the notebook for fine-tuning with the json dataset
### ChatbotRAG_Colab is the notebook for RAG approach with the same dataset(json)
### ChatbotRagPDF is the notebook for testing RAG with FAQ.pdf of MDE only(not included the json dataset)

## **Project Overview**
This project develops an **AI-powered chatbot** tailored to support **international students** at **IMT Mines Al√®s** by providing quick and accurate access to essential academic and administrative information. The solution integrates **fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3.1-8B**, enhanced through **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** and **4-bit quantization**, for a resource-efficient deployment.

Additionally, the project includes a **comparative study** of two development strategies: **Fine-tuning vs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, to evaluate performance, flexibility, and deployment feasibility.
